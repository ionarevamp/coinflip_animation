Run with `coinflip_animation DURATION COINSIZE`.
Running without arguments will default to 10 seconds and a diameter scaled to your terminal.

DETAILS:

The actual animation in question will be centered on the screen, and lock the terminal for the duration of the animation.

Also (currently), the program does not handle an interrupt gracefully so your cursor will stay hidden if you exit before it finishes.

This program is not intended for serious use.
